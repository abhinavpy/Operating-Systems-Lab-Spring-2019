Threads

A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes. In a process,
threads allow multiple executions of streams. In many respects, threads are popular way to improve application through parallelism. The CPU switches rapidly back and forth 
among the threads giving illusion that the threads are running in parallel
